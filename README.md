# NYC Taxi Data Pipeline

This project implements a data pipeline for processing and analyzing New York City taxi trip data using Mage AI, PostgreSQL, and Python.

## Project Overview

This data engineering pipeline extracts NYC yellow taxi trip data, transforms it, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database for further analysis. The project demonstrates ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data cleaning, and database operations.

## Components

1. **Data Extraction** (`brilliant_rune.py`)
   - Fetches NYC yellow taxi trip data from a public GitHub repository
   - Uses pandas to read CSV data directly from a URL

2. **Data Loading** (`scenic_bonsai.py`)
   - Loads sample data from the PostgreSQL database
   - Demonstrates querying capabilities

3. **Data Transformation** (`epic_charm.py`)
   - Includes a transformer action for reformatting data
   - Utilizes Mage AI's data cleaning capabilities

4. **Database Operations** (`ephemeral_mountain.py`)
   - Performs SQL transformations within PostgreSQL
   - Creates and populates a new table with transformed data

5. **Data Export** (`sincere_explorer.py`)
   - Exports transformed data back to PostgreSQL
   - Handles table creation and data insertion

## Key Features

- Integration with Mage AI for data preparation and transformation
- Use of PostgreSQL for data storage and complex SQL operations
- Pandas for data manipulation and CSV handling
- Configurable database connections using YAML files

## Setup and Usage

1. Ensure you have Python, Mage AI, and PostgreSQL installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the `io_config.yaml` file with your database credentials
4. Run the pipeline components in the following order:
   - Data Extraction
   - Data Loading
   - Data Transformation
   - Database Operations
   - Data Export

## Configuration

Database configuration is managed through `io_config.yaml`. Ensure this file is properly set up with your PostgreSQL connection details.

## Future Improvements

- Implement data quality checks and error handling
- Add visualization components for data analysis
- Extend the pipeline to handle real-time data streaming

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the pipeline are welcome. Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.
